### License  

1. What is the project's license?  
In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.  
* The project has an Apache license 2.0. Specifically it has a permissive license.
<br>
---

### Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?  
* The primary language is Java.
<br>

2. What is the development environment? For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?  
Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install?  
* In order to start developing extensions and scripts you would still have to install

* GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse. This plugin is easily downloadable from their homepage. The website is https://www.ghidra-sre.org/   .
<br>

3. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries?  
* Other than the distribution package that it provides on their website https://www.ghidra-sre.org/.   It can be typically run on user-interactive and automated modes.
<br>

4. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample.  
* Based on my random sample I think it is fairly doable. The random sample that I picked was written in bash, which I’ve had some previous experience in from a previous class. 
<br>

5. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/).  
* This is a huge project, the closest approximation is more than 2,800k and less than 3,000k.
<br>


6. Does the repository have tests?  
* Yes, it has a few sample tests for their extensions, plugins, as well as other scripts.
<br>

### Code and Design Documentation  
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself?  
* There is some documentations of different components ,of the project itself, in different readme’s. But it’s very disorganized and often hard to digest. 
<br>


2. Is there documentation about the design?  
* There is some documentation about the framework of the project, in different folders, but it is barely any. Most of the documentation is on the code itself if any code is documented.
<br>

### Activity Level  


1. How many commits have been made in the past week?  
* 17 week of Feb. 16 and 1 commit as of Feb. 23 =  18 commits in the past week
<br>

2. When was the most recent commit?  
* Most recent commit was today, Mon. Feb. 24, 2 hours ago
<br>

3. How many issues are currently open?  
* Currently 503 open issues
<br>

4. How long do issues stay open?  
Take the five most recently closed issues and look at when each was first reported.

* Issues remain open for about 38 days [(2+10+15+151+14)/5]
<br>

5. Is there active discussion on the issues?  
Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues.  
* Yes, there is active discussion on the issues
<br>

* No, issues are not tagged by difficulty
<br>

* 256 issues were closed in the past 6 months
<br>


8. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project?  
* No, but it is maintained by the National Security Agency (NSA) Research Directorate
<br>

9. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months?  
* 40 contributors in the past 6 months
<br>


10. How many open pull requests are there?  
* 69 open pull request
<br>

11. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time?  
Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.  
Take the five most recently closed ones and look at when each was first reported.  
Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.  
* Yes, requests remain unanswered for about 44 days on average
<br>

12. Is there active discussion on the pull requests?  
Use the same method as you did for the issues.  
* No, there is no active discussion on the pull requests
<br>

13. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months?  
* 44 pull requests were opened within the past 6 months
<br>

### Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?  
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.  
* The CONTRIBUTING document is _extremely_ clear and concise. It opens the document by listing ways the community can contribute to the project and seperates the remaining information in the sections:  
  * Bugs and Feature Requests
  * Patch Submission tips
  * Review
  * Getting Started
  * Timeline and Managing Expectations
  * Legal  
* The document is well organized and presented using basic language. This allows people with any git knowlege to easily understand the document.
<br>

2. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violte it?  
* There is no CODE OF CONDUCT document in this repository.
<br>

3. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?  
Are responses generally constructive?  
Read the issue conversations.  
* Maintainers seem to respond quickly and clearly to questions. In the long conversations, once a maintainer understood the issues and was able to replicate the problem (_if neccessary_), a thorough explaination was given. Maintainers typically explained why the problem occured and what the steps are to fix it. In short conversations, the issues were quickly resolved and required little clarification.  
Comments in issues were all either leading to more discussion or thankful. 
<br>

4. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?  
* People are professional and friendly in the issues. In one particular issue (_ titled: NullPointer Exception when running any Pything script #1513_), the author admitted they were "afraid to admit it for fear of ridicule, but I do not know how to do that [debugging and specific commands in Java]. The collaborator responded positively saying not to worry since many of their contributors do not know Java.
<br>

5. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?  
* Maintainers do not thank people in merge and pull requests. Typically in the shorter Issues maintainers also do not thank people, but occassionally in the longer ones, they will essentially say "_you're welcome_". Very rarely do they thank someone for presenting an issue.
<br>

### Summary
Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?  
* We do not think this is a project we would **want** to contribute to throught the semester. Although the community seems all around pleasant, the lack of a Code of Conduct shows us that the maintainers may be rude at any point of the project. Moreover, the issues are mostly untagged, so finding something to work on is almost a blind pick. Without reading through tens of issues and attempting many as well, a new community member would find it difficult to work on a issue appropiate for their level. Another issue we have with this project is 86% if it is coded in Java which the three of us have very little, _if not any_ coding knowledge in. Our contributions would likely be negligible or insufficient considering our skill level.
